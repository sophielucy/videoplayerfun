Folder contains the following files:

gesture-help.png
gentilis-normal-normal.js
index.html
script.js
styles.css
unistroke.js
README.txt

Both the unistroke.js and gentilis-normal-normal.js files were taken directly from the source files of $1 Unistroke Recognizer (https://depts.washington.edu/aimgroup/proj/dollar/) with some changes made to the unistroke.js file that accommodate the gestures I chose for the multiple video player.  


I chose to use the video (http://media.w3.org/2010/05/video/movie_300.mp4) so that the person grading could easily see the functionality of certain actions— seek and playback speeds in particular.

How to use:

1- Open the index.html file in browser from the “app” folder. 

When you open the application, the page is empty except for a "Help" button that allows the user to access documentation immediately. 

The documentation details how to use the application. 

Gestures can be made anywhere on the page although the location of the start and end point of the gesture determines whether all videos or just one video is controlled. 

Design Process:

1- looked at existing gestures from (https://depts.washington.edu/aimgroup/proj/dollar/)and matched them with the control actions
2- drew out new gestures for remaining control actions
3- played with existing recognizer to figure out the feel and identify potential chances for error
4- made a storyboard of how the application would work
5- edited the existing code to output new gestures
6- added new collection of gestures to existing recognizer to identify opportunities for error and see the feel of the gestures
7- using the existing recognizer, I built out the functions to accommodate the use cases for the video player 


Heuristics considered:

-Visibility of system status
-Match between system and the real world
-User control and freedom
-Error prevention
-Recognition rather than recall
-Aesthetic and minimalist design
-Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
-Help and documentation
